Translation stuff
=================

Settings
--------

Settings gained LanguageSettings -> languages, a structured string of
languages (e.g. en=English,nl=Dutch,es=Spanish)

Translations of translations
----------------------------

Theoretically, it is possible to create translations of translations. For
example, a user writes an article A (e.g. English), and a translation B
(Dutch) of A is created. A translation of B, C, can be created, and this can
even be in English again.

Fortunately the GUI prevents this from happening. :>

Synchronised publishing
-----------------------

Synchronised publishing means that an item and its translations will only be
really published when the item and its translations are all published. If one
translation, or the original, is not set to published, the other items will
not be published either.

Workflow integration
--------------------

Translations use the same workflow as normal items, so there is no need for a
separate translator workflow.

Notes:

- Easier without synchronized publishing. Articles don't have to wait.

- "Ready for publishing" step (right after "ready for reviewing" step)
  indicates the article is translatable.

Translator interface
--------------------

* Object appears when object is inversely translation-related to an object
  that is on or past the Translatable workflow step.

* Object disappears when published.

Examples:

* Dutch article. Workflow step: Draft. Even if this article is related through
  translation relations to other articles, they still won't show up.

* Dutch article. Workflow step: Ready for publishing. All articles that are
  related to this article, and that are not yet published, show up.
