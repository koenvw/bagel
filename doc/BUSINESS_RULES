Business Rules Stuff
====================

Example Rules
-------------

- regex-check a field
- correctly capitalize a first name
- check whether a given tag is present
- ...

Code
----

In the Code field, enter Ruby code that validates a given object. For
example:

	rule_errors << "Track list is empty" if obj.track_list.blank?

With helper methods, this becomes

	require_tag(obj, 'Rating')
